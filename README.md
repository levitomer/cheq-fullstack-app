    ```bash
    user: 'root',
    password: 'password!',

    ```

4. Go to the `server/db` sub-directory. Grab the ```config.sql``` dump file and load it in your DB client viewer.

5. Use the `vasts` database and execute the ```config.sql``` dump file to create a `Vasts` table with some content.

6. In the `server` directory, run ```npm i``` in order to install node_modules.

6. Finally, run ```npm i``` in order to start the server.
